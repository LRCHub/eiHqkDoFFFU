We've only just met
But I feel sure
We will be best friends
Sharing the joy
Of every step
We take together
This journey that we're on
Where both of us grow strong
This journey that ...
We'll make it together

Love the wonder in your eyes
The thrill of each
And every first time
The whole world is new
Baby hear it call
For me and you

This journey that we're on
Where both of us grow strong
This journey that ...
We'll make it together

Stumbles and falls, they may come
But I know that
They'll make you stronger
Through the rain and the shine
We learn about life
And grow together

This journey that we're on
Where both of us grow strong
This journey that ...
We'll make it together
Look how close we've got
Look how far we've come
And yet we've only just begun
This journey that we're on
Where both of us grow strong
This journey that ...
We'll make it together

This journey of a lifetime
O baby you and I
This journey that ...
We're sharing together
We share our love
We share our joy
