Late at night, call me on the phone
When I'm all alone and you whisper words of sweetness
Tried to fight, getting in the zone
Gotta stay at home, but since you know my weakness

You keep saying that you're real
Give me something I can really feel
Cause when you say the words
Can't help but feel the worse

Chase me, you know that I'm the one
So face me but I can't give it up
So easy what if you ain't true
I can't trust my whole heart to you, you, you, you, you

Sad today, walking to the [?]
With your friends, always like you don't know me
Nothing to say when I catch you
[?] you had something to show me

You keep saying that you're true
Tell you who they can give in to you
Cause when you say the words
Can't help but feel the worse

Chase me, you know that I'm the one
So face me but I can't give it up
So easy what if you ain't true
I can't trust my whole heart to you, you, you, you, you

Don't let this go just show me that you're true
Just let me know you won't break my heart in two
Patience is a virtue, I won't hurt you, won't deserve you
If you just hold on, would've been yours all along, along

Chase me, you know that I'm the one
So face me but I can't give it up
So easy what if you ain't true
I can't trust my whole heart to you, you, you, you, you
