Pimpin' sluts, pimpin hoes, riding clean, smoking dope
Got my main bitch, pussy soaking as she give me throat
Whippin' with no 'caine, it's the mane with them diamond rangs
Strapped up with that thang for a lame to blow out they brain
Cruisin' like a mack, Wetto be pulling up like he the mayor (skrt)
Bitches that want me to save 'em, nah
Fuck 'em and put 'em in labour, nah
Creeping with one in the chamber, smoke a sucker like crack
Cutthroat maniac, took his hoe down to the track
Landed in the 504, at 5:04, yeah
Back at home where life's a bore, try not to snore
I should fly some bitches down and about five or four (okay)
Four or five days later, later alligator
I rarely think about when's the next tour
From recordin' in my shed to havin' like three roofs over my head
Ruby levelled up
I got like six whips, I don't need the keys to the Rover truck, anymore
Punchin' the palm trees, swing in the breeze, a moment of peace
I hope there's plenty more

She gave me dome so good, I think she thinks the Earth is flat
Mouth like the fuckin' firmament, she got my eyes rollin' back
Face a blunt, she rolls 'em back to back (back to back)
And when she bitches, she knows what the fuck I'm textin' back
Ruby slick with these hoes, I keep 'em froze
Snow Leopard holds a black rose real close, yeah
I've had enough heartbreak, star breaks
To stop 'em like car breaks, Oddy chilling like a pose, I won't post
Hoes, they want the screwing, I'm just looking for the chewing, mane
Chrome thang riding while I swang, swervin' lane to lane
Sippin' on some drank with a skank, got a cokehead name
Something like Brandy or Candy, maybe Tammy
Fuck it, they all the same
Part of the gang, I don't trip, I just give 'em dick
Off the fent looking like a lick, pimpin' like a mink
Lunatic Slicky run the North like the Bolsheviks
Come on, bitch, fuck her back outdoors, now my neighbor pissed
